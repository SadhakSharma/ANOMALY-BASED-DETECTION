# 🚨 Anomaly-Based Detection Using AI

This project presents an AI-powered anomaly detection system designed to enhance cybersecurity by identifying unusual patterns in system or network behavior without relying on predefined attack signatures or labeled attack data.

## 📌 Project Overview

Traditional rule-based intrusion detection systems often fail to catch novel or evolving threats, making AI-based approaches critical for real-time and adaptive threat detection. By leveraging unsupervised and semi-supervised machine learning models—such as Autoencoders, K-Means clustering, and LSTM neural networks—the system learns baseline behavior and detects deviations that may indicate anomalies like insider threats or zero-day attacks.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a system that detects anomalies without relying on labeled attack data.
- Compare and evaluate various AI/ML models to find the most effective one.
- Optimize for real-time performance with low false positives and computational overhead.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow & Keras
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🧪 Features

- Real-time anomaly detection
- Unsupervised learning with adaptive behavior modeling
- Modular, scalable, and deployable on edge or cloud infrastructure
- Evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
